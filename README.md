#Work breakdown structure (WBS) and Implementation
----------------------------------------------------

#Backend:
---------

#API Servers:

1. Two API Servers using Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) for high availability and scalability.
2 .Implement autoscaling for one of the API servers in the GKE cluster.

#Cloud SQL:
1. Use Google Cloud SQL for the Relational Database Service (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL).
2 .Create a Cloud SQL instance, configure databases, and ensure secure access.


#Redis Server:
1. Create a Memorystore instance to handle caching and session management.


#SSL Certificates and Domains:

1. Obtain SSL certificates from a trusted Certificate Authority or use Google-managed SSL certificates.
2. Configure Google Cloud Load Balancing to manage SSL termination and route traffic to the backend services.


#Frontend:
----------
#GCP Cloud CDN:
1. Implement Google Cloud CDN to enhance the frontend's performance and reduce latency.
2. Configure CDN to cache content close to the users and ensure fast content delivery.


#Access Restriction:

1. Use Google Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) to restrict access to the frontend.
2. Control who can access the resources and services.


#Continuous Integration/Deployment:
------------------------------------
#CI/CD Option:
1. Integrate a CI/CD tool like Google Cloud Build for automating deployment.
2. Cloud Build can automatically build and deploy new versions of the application.

#Networking:
-----------
#Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):

1.Create a custom VPC network for isolation and control of resources.
2. Define subnets to segment resources logically.

#Firewall Rules:

1.Set up firewall rules to control incoming and outgoing traffic.
2.Ensure that only necessary ports are open.

#Load Balancer:

1.Use Google's Load Balancer to distribute traffic to the API Servers and CDN.
2. Configure load balancer settings to ensure high availability and scalability.
